I created this tutorial as I could not find a simple and easy to understand method to add OAuth using Vercel functions to [DecapCMS](https://decapcms.org). But in this tutorial I'll also show you how to add DecamCMS to an existing Astro project to edit the site using an admin interface.

## Getting started

For this tutorial we'll need the following:

1. A Github and Vercel account (its free).
2. A project in which you want to add DecapCMS. We'll use the [Astro blog template](https://astro.build/themes/details/blog/) for this tutorial.
3. A custom domain (not mandatory but good to have).

Let's get started 

## Creating the Astro site

Create a new project with the Astro blog template. You can keep the directory name as `blog`.

```shell
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

After following the steps you'll have the following directory structure.

```restructuredtext
ðŸ“¦blog
 â”£ ðŸ“‚.astro
 â”£ ðŸ“‚.vscode
 â”£ ðŸ“‚public
 â”£ ðŸ“‚src
 â”£ ðŸ“œ.gitignore
 â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
 â”£ ðŸ“œastro.config.mjs
 â”£ ðŸ“œpackage-lock.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
 â”— ðŸ“œtsconfig.json
```
