I created this tutorial as I could not find a simple and easy to understand method to add OAuth using Vercel functions to [DecapCMS](https://decapcms.org). But in this tutorial I'll also show you how to add DecamCMS to an existing Astro project to edit the site using an admin interface.

## Getting started

For this tutorial we'll need the following:

1. Node.js installed (v22+).
2. A Github and Vercel account (its free).
3. A project in which you want to add DecapCMS. We'll use the [Astro blog template](https://astro.build/themes/details/blog/) for this tutorial.
4. A custom domain (not mandatory but good to have).

Let's get started 

## Setting up the Astro site

### Cloning the starter project

Create a new project with the Astro blog template. You can keep the directory name as `blog`.

```shell
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

After following the steps you'll have the following directory structure.

```
ðŸ“¦blog
 â”£ ðŸ“‚.astro
 â”£ ðŸ“‚.vscode
 â”£ ðŸ“‚public
 â”£ ðŸ“‚src
 â”£ ðŸ“œ.gitignore
 â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
 â”£ ðŸ“œastro.config.mjs
 â”£ ðŸ“œpackage-lock.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
 â”— ðŸ“œtsconfig.json
```

Now, run the project.

```shell
npm dev
```

And go to <http://localhost:4321>. You'll be able to see the site.

### Adding a post

Now we'll add a post to the site. Go to `src/content/blog` and create a file named `test.md`

```markdown
---
title: "Test 1"
description: "created using code editor"
pubDate: "Mar 27 2025"
heroImage: "/blog-placeholder-4.jpg"
---

This is a test post

```



Save the file and go to the blog section of the site. Open the **Test 1** post.

## Deploying the site

Your site is now ready to be deployed. First we'll push the code to Github and then deploy it using vercel.

### Pushing to Github

Create an [empty repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) in Github and push the code.

```
git remote add origin <your repository url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Deploy on vercel

Login to Vercel using Github for easy configuration. Then add a new project. Choose **Import Git Repository.**

Finally, click **Deploy.**

Wait for the site to get deployed. When the site is deployed click on the url to open the site.
